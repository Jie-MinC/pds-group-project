# Comparison between ML Predictive Models

We have came out with a list of predictive models, 

| Predictive Models     | Accuracy      | 
| ----------------------|:-------------:|
| SVM                   |               | 
| Random Forest         |               |   
| Regression            |               |

# Correlation Analytics of Features
This analysis answers Q3, which is "What are the statistical relationship between the influencing factors and resale price?"

``` {r,echo=F}
sgpropertydata = read.csv("C:\\Users\\Wei Wen\\OneDrive - Universiti Malaya\\Documents\\data_clean.csv")
street.aov <- aov(resale_price ~ street_name, data = sgpropertydata)
summary(street.aov)
flattype.aov <- aov(resale_price ~ flat_type, data = sgpropertydata)
summary(flattype.aov)
storey.aov <- aov(resale_price ~ storey_range, data = sgpropertydata)
summary(storey.aov)
flatmodel.aov <- aov(resale_price ~ flat_model, data = sgpropertydata)
summary(flatmodel.aov)
region.aov <- aov(resale_price ~ region, data = sgpropertydata)
summary(region.aov)
library(car)
ancova_model <- aov(resale_price ~ region + flat_model, data = sgpropertydata)
Anova(ancova_model, type="III")
```
__The ANOVA and ANCOVA result serve to inform on whether are there significant mean difference between variables of__
- flat type
- flat model
- storey range
- street name
- region

This will give us better confidence and decision-making during dropping/grouping these variable data.

As denoted by the *** symbol on the Pr(>F) column, there __is significant mean difference for all variables.__
